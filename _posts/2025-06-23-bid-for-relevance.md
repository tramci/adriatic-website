  In Slovenia's increasingly atomised political landscape, Vladimir Prebilič's
  decision to launch a new party ahead of the 2026 parliamentary elections may
  appear a bold personal gamble.
---
But behind the move lies a deeper narrative: one of strategic disaffection with a political class he describes as paralysed by caution and bereft of vision.

At a press conference marking the formal start of his new venture, Prebilič announced the party would be unveiled at a founding congress on 18 October. There, he promises to introduce his team and present a programme aimed at what he calls “a transparent, courageous politics – starting with clearly defined positions both internationally and at home”.

“I simply believe we’ve had enough,” he said, referring to what he sees as a political culture that “throws integrity over the shoulder” and applies the law selectively. "We need a brave kind of politics."

Prebilič has made a point of dampening any messianic fervour surrounding his candidacy, declaring, “I don’t want to be a messiah.” Instead, he insists his party will be a platform for a broad mix of individuals – those “motivated, willing, capable and ready to contribute to Slovenia’s development.”

Yet, for all the appeals to inclusivity, his decision not to resign his European Parliament seat until he is elected domestically has raised eyebrows. Critics claim it signals hedging rather than conviction. He counters that the mandate will be returned only “in the event of incompatibility” with a domestic post – hardly a full-throated leap into the national fray.

His recent engagements with former presidents and prime ministers – Borut Pahor, Anton Rop, Miro Cerar, and Milan Kučan – reflect a bid for institutional gravitas. But Kučan, long wary of fragmentation on the left, is said to have expressed misgivings about yet another electoral vehicle appearing in an already saturated field.

Prebilič acknowledges the tension: “It’s right that we maintain democratic pluralism. Let the voters choose, based on arguments.”

That measured tone contrasts sharply with his strained interaction with Prime Minister Robert Golob. The two men reportedly parted ways during a terse exchange over a proposed referendum boycott. “For me, that was absolutely out of the question,” Prebilič said. “I’ve worked for two decades in the field of civic engagement. To call for non-participation would completely undermine everything I stand for.”

Political philosopher Boris Vezjak, writing in response to the party launch, doubts Prebilič’s ideological clarity. “He positions himself on the left,” Vezjak noted, “but it is very likely he will operate as a centrist.” The discomfort with Vesna’s pre-election alignment with Levica, and his refusal to embrace a unified left front, point toward a role within what Vezjak terms the “third bloc” – a cluster of parties outside the mainstream left-right duopoly.

The subtext of Prebilič’s appeal is, perhaps, best understood as a carefully staged act of strategic ambiguity. While he champions civil dialogue and a robust public sector, his real pitch appears directed at a disillusioned electorate that has grown weary of ideological purity and coalition compromise.

To that end, Prebilič has confirmed cooperation with former MEP Klemen Grošelj and political adviser Matija Sevšek, whose CVs reflect a technocratic bent rather than populist fervour. The party is not yet named, and many of its positions remain undefined – a void his critics see as a liability, but which he frames as openness.

“There’s room for people who want to contribute,” he said. “We don’t want a one-face party.”

In that context, Prebilič’s initiative offers at least the prospect of novelty. But novelty, as Slovenia has learned, is no guarantee of durability. Unless his October congress yields a substantive programme – and unless he can define a coalition of willing allies without falling into the trap of leftist redundancy – he risks becoming yet another footnote in a long line of political resets.

What is certain, however, is that his candidacy forces a broader reckoning for the centre-left. If Prebilič draws support from disaffected Svoboda voters or those uneasy with Levica’s programme, he may reshape the field. If not, he could simply reinforce the fragmentation he claims to oppose.

The election will determine whether his diagnosis of Slovenian politics is one the public shares – or whether the electorate, having seen this drama before, will opt to sit this one out.
