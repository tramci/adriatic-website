  <h1>Newsletter</h1>

  <p><em>The Adriatic</em> arrives in your inbox every two weeks with a curated selection of what we've been reading, writing, and thinking about.</p>

  <p>Each edition brings together our latest essays and editor's picks, short dispatches from across the region, and conversations with the people shaping Adriatic business, politics, and culture.</p>

  <p>It's also how we gather. Over the years we've cultivated a community of readers who share our curiosity about the region and the wider world, and the newsletter is where we announce the events that bring us together: talks, dinners, and our annual Strategic Foresight gathering in Ljubljana.</p>

  <p>No daily digests, no algorithmic clutter. Just a fortnightly briefing from our corner of Europe, and an invitation to be part of the conversation.</p>
