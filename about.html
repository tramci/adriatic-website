  <h1>Our credo</h1>
  <h2>Follow the current, not the noise.</h2>

  <p>We began as <em>Strategic Foresight</em> — a publication founded in 2011 to map the intersection of geopolitics, economics, and long-term trends. For nearly a decade, we examined risk, transformation, and the forces shaping the Adriatic region and beyond.</p>

  <p>By 2019, the world had changed faster than foresight could predict. What once felt like the future had become the present. The boundaries between business, politics, and culture blurred; analysis demanded context, not just data. We responded by evolving into  — a magazine for those navigating this new complexity.</p>

  <p>Today, <em>The Adriatic</em> stands at the confluence of policy and perspective. We write for decision-makers, strategists, and the globally minded — readers who understand that economics is never just about numbers, and politics never just about power. Our aim is simple: to interpret change, not merely record it.</p>

  <p>We publish online throughout the year and in print annually, combining analysis with narrative journalism. Each issue is an attempt to explain where the region fits in the wider world — and where the wider world, in turn, is heading.</p>
