  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p><em>The Adriatic</em> is the publishing arm of the Institute for Strategic Solutions (ISR), a Ljubljana-based think-tank and consultancy working since 2011 to help businesses connect, position themselves, and navigate complexity.</p>

  <p>What began as <em>Strategic Foresight</em>, a bulletin tracking shifts in politics, markets, and regional dynamics, has evolved into something more ambitious. <em>The Adriatic</em> is a publication for readers who want to understand the forces shaping this region and the world beyond it. We publish essays, reportage, and analysis on politics, business, and culture, with a perspective rooted in the Adriatic but never confined by it.</p>

  <p>Our motto is simple: follow the current, not the noise. In a media landscape dominated by speed and reaction, we aim for depth, clarity, and work that endures beyond the news cycle.</p>

  <p><em>The Adriatic</em> appears online throughout the year, with an annual print edition marking each year's most essential reading.</p>
