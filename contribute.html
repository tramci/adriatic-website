  <p><em>The Adriatic</em> publishes essays, reportage, and criticism that bring the region into sharper focus and speak from this corner of Europe to the wider world. We're interested in writers who can do both: illuminate what's happening here, and offer a perspective unavailable elsewhere.</p>

  <p>We cover politics, business, and culture across the Adriatic, but we're not a regional publication in the parochial sense. A piece on port logistics in Koper might sit alongside an essay on American decline or a profile of a Croatian architect reshaping how we think about public space. What unites our work is ambition, clarity, and a cosmopolitan sensibility rooted in place.</p>

  <p>We welcome submissions from across the region and beyond, from journalists, academics, analysts, and writers who have something to say and the means to say it well. We're particularly interested in work that wouldn't find a natural home elsewhere, be it too specific for the global generalists, or too ambitious for the local press.</p>

  <h2>Submissions</h2>

  <p>Send completed drafts of at least 500 words to <a href="mailto:info@isr.si">info@isr.si</a>. Include a brief note on who you are and why this piece belongs in <em>The Adriatic</em>. We read everything; we respond when we're interested.</p>
